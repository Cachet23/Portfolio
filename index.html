        <h2>üìú My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          After finishing gymnasium in Germany, I decided to take a detour from pure informatics studies to work on music and  as a webshop-host.
        </p>

        <p>
          The siren call of AI lured me back to academia, where I found a home at Neuroforge, a rising AI-Solutions company in Bayreuth.

        <h2>üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª Work History</h2>
        <h3>Holiday IT Hustles</h3>
        <p>
          I gained valuable experience working with sensor data at BHS-Corrugated. In addition, I held several other positions where a solid understanding of IT fundamentals was required. This includes a role at a german plastics company.
        </p>
        <h3>SinnWunder</h3>
        <p>
          At SinnWunder, I wore many hats - from webshop host to product photographer and video creator, even dipping my toes into marketing and social media strategies.
        </p>
        <h3>Neuroforge</h3>
        <p>
          Neuroforge is my launchpad to AI. Here, I've been part of various AI missions, learning about the lifecycle of a full-stack software project in a resource-rich environment.

        <h2>üìö Projects <a href="https://github.com/Cachet23" target="_blank" style="font-size: 0.8em; margin-left: 10px;">(GitHub Repo)</a></h2>
        <h3>MultiAgentSystem</h3>
        <p>
          A university project that introduced me to the principle of 'emergence' through the creation of a 'Langton's Ant' MultiAgentSystem.
        </p>
        <h3>Q* Search Algorithm Presentation</h3>
        <p>
          This presentation was the most challenging and demanding one I've ever delivered. I collaborated with a professor specializing in reinforcement learning to develop the content. It also stands out as the most innovative topic I've tackled to date.
        </p>
        <h3>Mobile & Ubiquitous Computing Project</h3>
        <p>
          In this project, we developed a biosensor application utilizing the ESP32 microcontroller paired with a MAX30100 pulse oximeter sensor. The data collected by the sensor is transmitted using the MQTT protocol and processed through Node-RED. For visualization, a web application was built using React and TypeScript, allowing real-time monitoring and analysis of the biosensor data.
        </p>
        <h3>LLM Summarizer</h3>
        <p>
          This has been my most significant project to date. It involved developing a microservice hosted on a FastAPI web server. The service utilizes the Ollama LLM to summarize Microsoft Teams messages, enabling employees to quickly catch up on any missed discussions. Stay in the loop ‚àû
