        <h2>üìú My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          After finishing gymnasium in Germany, I decided to take a detour from pure informatics studies to work on music and host a webshop.
        </p>

        <p>
          My passion for AI led me to start university studies in this field. Alongside my studies, I started working at Neuroforge, an AI company based in Bayreuth.

        <h2>üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª Work History</h2>
        <h3>Holiday IT Hustles</h3>
        <p>
          I gained valuable experience working with sensor data at BHS-Corrugated. In addition, I held several other positions where a solid understanding of IT fundamentals was required. This includes a role at a german plastics company.
        </p>
        <h3>SinnWunder</h3>
        <p>
          After leaving my studies, I worked as a webshop host at SinnWunder. This role not only allowed me to gain experience in product photography and creating promotional videos from scratch, but also led me into the realm of marketing, including social media strategies.
        </p>
        <h3>Neuroforge</h3>
        <p>
          At Neuroforge, I've been involved in various AI projects. This role has provided me with the best opportunities to advance my tech knowledge while simultaneously working on practical projects that require hardware resources beyond what I could access privately. I particularly enjoy learning about the lifecycle of a full-stack software project in this supportive and resource-rich environment.

        <h2>üìö Projects</h2>
        <h3>MultiAgentSystem</h3>
        <p>
          During my university studies, I collaborated on a project to create a 'Langton's Ant' MultiAgentSystem. The most valuable lesson from this project was gaining a deep understanding of the principle of 'emergence'.
        </p>
        <h3>IoT with Raspberry Pi</h3>
        <p>
          In a team project, we developed a game that could be played on a Raspberry Pi and controlled remotely via a Wi-Fi connection. This was achieved by tilting a second Raspberry Pi. This translates into reading sensor data and processing it over the internet.
        </p>
        <h3>LLM Summarizer</h3>
        <p>
          This has been my most significant project to date. It involved developing a microservice hosted on a FastAPI web server. The service utilizes the Ollama LLM to summarize Microsoft Teams messages, enabling employees to quickly catch up on any missed discussions.
