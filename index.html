        <h2>📜 My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          After finishing gymnasium in Germany, I decided to take a detour from pure informatics studies to work on music and host a webshop.
        </p>

        <p>
          The siren call of AI lured me back to academia, where I found a home at Neuroforge, an AI startup in Bayreuth.

        <h2>🧑🏽‍💻 Work History</h2>
        <h3>Holiday IT Hustles</h3>
        <p>
          I gained valuable experience working with sensor data at BHS-Corrugated. In addition, I held several other positions where a solid understanding of IT fundamentals was required. This includes a role at a german plastics company.

        <h3>SinnWunder</h3>
        <p>
          At SinnWunder, I wore many hats - from webshop host to product photographer and video creator, even dipping my toes into marketing and social media strategies.
        </p>
        <h3>Neuroforge</h3>
        <p>
          Neuroforge is my launchpad to AI. Here, I've been part of various AI missions, learning about the lifecycle of a full-stack software project in a resource-rich environment.

        <h2>📚 Projects</h2>
        <h3>MultiAgentSystem</h3>
        <p>
          A university project that introduced me to the principle of 'emergence' through the creation of a 'Langton's Ant' MultiAgentSystem.
        </p>
        <h3>IoT with Raspberry Pi</h3>
        <p>
          A team project that transformed a Raspberry Pi into a game console, controlled remotely via Wi-Fi by tilting another Raspberry Pi.
        </p>
        <h3>LLM Summarizer</h3>
        <p>
          This has been my most significant project to date. It involved developing a microservice hosted on a FastAPI web server. The service utilizes the Ollama LLM to summarize Microsoft Teams messages, enabling employees to quickly catch up on any missed discussions.
