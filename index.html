        <h2>📜 My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          After finishing gymnasium in Germany, I decided to take a detour from pure informatics studies to work on music and host a webshop. During this time, I also gained experience in product photography.
        </p>

        <p>
          My passion for AI led me to start university studies in this field. Alongside my studies, I started working at Neuroforge, an AI company based in Bayreuth.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Neuroforge, I've been involved in projects such as creating a LLM summarizer web service for a web app and integrating it. In university, I partnered on a project to create a MAS Langton's Ant and remotely control a game with two Raspberry Pis.
